    <h1>About Pune</h1>
    <p>
        Pune, city, west-central Maharashtra state, western India, at the junction of the Mula and Mutha rivers. Called “Queen of the Deccan,” Pune is the cultural capital of the Maratha peoples. The city first gained importance as the capital of the Bhonsle Marathas in the 17th century. It was temporarily captured by the Mughals but again served as the official Maratha capital from 1714 until its fall to the British in 1817. It was the seasonal capital of the Bombay Presidency and is now a popular tourist resort, offering cool weather, historic and religious monuments, museums, parks, hotels, and cultural attractions.
Aga Khan Palace (Gandhi National Memorial), Pune, India.
Pune has long been a major educational and cultural centre; former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru referred to it as the “Oxford and Cambridge of India.” The city houses some 30 constituent and affiliated colleges of the University of Pune (1948); the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (1917) is renowned for research and instruction in the Sanskrit and Prakrit languages and has more than 20,000 ancient manuscripts. Pune is also the headquarters of the southern command of the Indian army, with the Khadakwasla Academy located nearby.

        <img src="imeges/wada-pune.jpg" alt=""><br>
      <p> One of the finest specimens of architecture in the city is Shaniwar Wada, a 286-year-old mansion that was originally the Peshwa capital of Pune. Peshwa Bajirao I himself constructed this mansion to serve as the home of Peshwas.
Although the Wada now spans 625 acres, it nearly engulfed the entire city during its prominence. With many forts, fountains, and the imposing statue of Baji Rao I that welcomes guests at the entry, the location never fails to astound visitors.

        <p>The historical fortress Sinhagad Fort is situated in the Sahyadri Mountains and is well known for its architectural and historical significance. Formerly known as Kondana, it has seen several engagements, including the famous Battle of Sinhagad in 1670. The name "Sinhagad'' directly translates to "Lion's Fort," denoting the fort's valour and brightness.
Moreover, the building is now the ideal landmark for hikers because of its location in the Sahyadri Mountains at a height of over 750 metres.</p>
